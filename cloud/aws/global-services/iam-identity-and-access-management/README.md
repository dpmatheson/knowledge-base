# IAM - Identity & Access Management

### Users & Groups

* Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared.
* Users are people within your organistion and can be grouped.
* Groups can only contain users, not other groups.
* Users don't have to belong to a group, and a user can belong to multiple groups.

### Permissions

* Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
* &#x20; The policies define permissions of the users
* Apply the **least privileged principle**; don't give more permissions than a user needs.
